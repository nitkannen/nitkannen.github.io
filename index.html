              <p > Thanks for visiting. Currently, I am a researcher (AI resident) at <a https://deepmind.google/" > Google DeepMind</a>. I am interested in 
		enabling models to become natively multimodalâ€”learning from and integrating multiple modalities as seamlessly as humans do. I am also excited by pluralistic alignment: aligning multimodal models to reflect the diverse preferences and intentions of individuals across different cultures. 
		Beyond these areas, I am always excited to explore new topics and challenges in AI research. 
		<p>
		      
		      Previously, I was with <a href="https://www.amazon.science/" > Amazon Alexa AI</a> in London working on <i>machine learning for ranking and recommendation</i>. 
		Before that, I graduated with an Integrated Masters (BS + MS) in EECS (<a href="http://www.ee.iitkgp.ac.in/" > Electrical and </a>
          	<a href="http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/" > Computer Science Engineering </a> )
                from  <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/" > IIT Kharagpur </a>.  
		I did my Masters Thesis with <a href="https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~pawang//" > Prof. Pawan Goyal </a> at
		<a href="https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/" > CNeRG Lab </a> which is now published at <b>EMNLP 2023</b> (Findings). My Masters Thesis was awarded the <b> Best Project Award</b> amongst 2023 graduating students.

I am currently at <b>Google DeepMind</b>. My goal is to make multimodal models <b>pluralistic</b>: adapt to diverse population groups to ensure safety and alignment to intentions and values of a broader spectrum of humanity.
<br>
<br>
While over 200 million people actively use AI today, this represents only a fraction of the 5 billion internet users who will one day engage with it. As AI usage expands across humanityâ€”touching people from diverse cultural and socioeconomic backgroundsâ€”we may not yet grasp the full spectrum of use cases that will emerge.
In order for AI to be equally transformative for <i>all</i>, I believe we must invest in making models pluralistic to diverse intentions and usage contexts of different cultures.
I currently look into this from an a) evaluation lens: creating meaningful and representative benchmarks to assess inclusivity and b) inference time pluralism: steering models to align with varied human world models.
I am also interested in the fairness and safety aspects of multimodal models. I previously contributed to the <a href="https://www.indianext.co.in/project-bindi-was-launched-by-google-to-combat-social-biases-in-ai-models/" > Bindi Project</a> at Google.
I have worked with Amazon Alexa AI at Germany, Amazon Info AI in the UK, and IBM Research AI in India. I have experience in Temporal Reasoning, QA, Conversation and Dialogue, Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis, Multilingual NLP and Recommender Systems.

              <p >User prompts for generative AI models are often underspecified, leading to sub-optimal responses. This problem is particularly evident in text-to-image (T2I) generation, where users commonly struggle to articulate their precise intent. This disconnect between the user's vision and the model's interpretation often forces users to painstakingly and repeatedly refine their prompts. To address this, we propose a design for proactive T2I agents equipped with an interface to (1) actively ask clarification questions when uncertain, and (2) present their understanding of user intent as an understandable belief graph that a user can edit. We build simple prototypes for such agents and verify their effectiveness through both human studies and automated evaluation. We observed that at least 90% of human subjects found these agents and their belief graphs helpful for their T2I workflow. Moreover, we develop a scalable automated evaluation approach using two agents, one with a ground truth image and the other tries to ask as few questions as possible to align with the ground truth. On DesignBench, a benchmark we created for artists and designers, the COCO dataset (Lin et al., 2014), and ImageInWords (Garg et al., 2024), we observed that these T2I agents were able to ask informative questions and elicit crucial information to achieve successful alignment with at least 2 times higher VQAScore (Lin et al., 2024) than the standard single-turn T2I generation  </p>

              <p >Text-to-Image (T2I) models are being increasingly adopted in diverse global communities where they create visual representations of their unique cultures. Current T2I benchmarks primarily focus on faithfulness, aesthetics, and realism of generated images, overlooking the critical dimension of cultural competence. In this work, we introduce a framework to evaluate cultural competence of T2I models along two crucial dimensions: cultural awareness and cultural diversity, and present a scalable approach using a combination of structured knowledge bases and large language models to build a large dataset of cultural artifacts to enable this evaluation. In particular, we apply this approach to build CUBE (CUltural BEnchmark for Text-to-Image models), a first-of-its-kind benchmark to evaluate cultural competence of T2I models. CUBE covers cultural artifacts associated with 8 countries across different geo-cultural regions and along 3 concepts: cuisine, landmarks, and art. CUBE consists of 1) CUBE-1K, a set of high-quality prompts that enable the evaluation of cultural awareness, and 2) CUBE-CSpace, a larger dataset of cultural artifacts that serves as grounding to evaluate cultural diversity. We also introduce cultural diversity as a novel T2I evaluation component, leveraging quality-weighted Vendi score. Our evaluations reveal significant gaps in the cultural awareness of existing models across countries and provide valuable insights into the cultural diversity of T2I outputs for under-specified prompts. Our methodology is extendable to other cultural regions and concepts, and can facilitate the development of T2I models that better cater to the global population.  </p>

              <p >News recommendation is a challenging task that involves personalization based on the interaction history and preferences of each user. Recent works have leveraged the power of pretrained language models (PLMs) to directly rank news items by using inference approaches that predominately fall into three categories: pointwise, pairwise, and listwise learning-to-rank. While pointwise methods offer linear inference complexity, they fail to capture crucial comparative information between items that is more effective for ranking tasks. Conversely, pairwise and listwise approaches excel at incorporating these comparisons but suffer from practical limitations: pairwise approaches are either computationally expensive or lack theoretical guarantees and listwise methods often perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for PLM-based news recommendation that integrates both pointwise relevance prediction and pairwise comparisons in a scalable manner. We present a rigorous theoretical analysis of our framework, establishing conditions under which our approach guarantees improved performance. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the MIND and Adressa news recommendation datasets.  </p>

              <p >Temporal question answering (QA) is a special category of complex question answering task that requires reasoning over facts asserting time intervals of events. Previous works have predominately relied on Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) for temporal QA. One  of the major challenges faced by these systems is their inability to retrieve all relevant facts  due to factors such as incomplete KB and entity/relation linking errors (Patidar et al., 2022). A failure to fetch even a single fact will block KBQA from computing the answer. Such cases of KB incompleteness are even more profound in the temporal context. To address this issue, we explore an interesting direction where a targeted temporal fact extraction technique is used to assist KBQA whenever it fails to retrieve temporal facts from the KB. We model the extraction problem as an open-domain question answering task using off-the-shelf language models. This way, we target to extract from textual resources those facts that failed to get retrieved from the KB. Experimental results on two temporal QA benchmarks show promising 30% & 10% relative improvements in answer  accuracies without any additional training cost.</p>

              <p >Existing works on Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) explicitly focus on developing more efficient fine-tuning approaches for the task. Different from these, we propose CONTRASTE, a novel pre-training strategy using CONTRastive learning to improve the performance of the downstream ASTE task. Given a sentence and its associated (aspect, opinion, sentiment) triplets, first, we design aspect-based prompts with corresponding sentiments masked. We then (pre)train an encoder-decoder architecture by applying contrastive learning on the decoder-generated aspect-aware sentiment representations of the masked terms. For fine-tuning the pre-trained model weights thus obtained, we then propose a novel multi-task approach where the base encoder-decoder framework is combined with two complementary modules, a tagging-based Opinion Term Detector, and a regression-based Triplet Count Estimator. Exhaustive experiments on four benchmark datasets and a detailed ablation study establish the importance of each of our proposed components as we achieve new state-of-the-art results for the ASTE task. We further demonstrate that our proposed pre-training scheme can improve the performance of other ABSA tasks such as Aspect Category Opinion Sentiment (ACOS) quad prediction, Target Aspect Sentiment Detection (TASD), and Aspect Extraction and Sentiment Classification (AESC).  </p>

              <p >Acronyms and long-forms are a common sight in research documents in general, more so in documents from scientific and legal domains. Many of the acronyms used in these documents are domain-specific, and are very rarely found in normal text corpora. Owing to this, transformer-based NLP models suffer while detecting OOV (Out of Vocabulary) for acronym tokens and their performance suffers while linking acronyms to their long forms during extraction. Moreover, transformer-based models like BERT are not specialized to handle scientific and legal documents. With these points being the overarching motivation behind this work, we propose a novel framework <b>CABACE</b>: <b>C</b>haracter-<b>A</b>ware <b>B</b>ERT for <b>AC</b>ronym <b>E</b>xtraction, that takes into account character sequences in text, and is adapted to the scientific and legal domains by masked language modelling. We further use an objective function with augmented loss function, adding mask + max loss for training CABACE. Experimental results prove the superiority of the proposed framework in comparison to various baselines. Additionally, we show that the proposed framework is better suited than baseline models for zero-shot generalization to non-English languages, thus reinforcing the effectiveness of our approach. Our team BacKGProp secured the highest scores on the French dataset, second highest on Danish and Vietnamese, and third highest in the Legal English dataset on the global Codalab leaderboard for the acronym extraction shared task at SDU AAAI-22.</p>

              <p >Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) systems have the goal of answering complex natural language questions by reasoning over relevant facts retrieved from Knowledge Bases (KB). One of the major challenges faced by these systems is their inability to retrieve all relevant facts due to factors such as incomplete KB and entity/relation linking errors. In this paper, we address this particular challenge for systems handling a specific category of questions called temporal questions, where answer derivation involve reasoning over facts asserting point/intervals of time for various events. We propose a novel approach where a targeted temporal fact extraction technique is used to assist KBQA whenever it fails to retrieve temporal facts from the KB. We use Î»-expressions of the questions to logically represent the component facts and the reasoning steps needed to derive the answer. This allows us to spot those facts that failed to get retrieved from the KB and generate textual queries to extract them from the textual resources in an open-domain question answering fashion. We evaluated our approach on a benchmark temporal question answering dataset considering Wikidata and Wikipedia respectively as the KB and textual resource. Experimental results show a significant âˆ¼30\% relative improvement in answer accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p>
