               I am excited by the current trends in Language Research, particularly in NLP tasks that necessitate reasoning capabilities of systems. In the longer run, I wish
	       to enable development of Language Technology that can reason not just in English, but also in Low-Resource (think multilingual) languages. 
	       Some of my past works have spanned the areas of Multi-Hop Question Answering, Knowledge Graphs, Temporal Reasoning, Information Extraction and Low-Resource NLP. I am  
	        also interested to explore newer areas of NLP or its intersection with Speech or Fundamental DL. Hmu if you are interested in NLP, Reasoning, Multilinguality, DL or anything remotely close 
		      and want to have a discussion. I have been fortunate to have received great guidance and mentorship from my collaborators thus far. I am happy to guide younger folks new to the space. Feel free to reach out!

              <p >Temporal question answering (QA) is a special category of complex question answering task that requires reasoning over facts asserting time intervals of events. Previous works have predominately relied on Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) for temporal QA. One  of the major challenges faced by these systems is their inability to retrieve all relevant facts  due to factors such as incomplete KB and entity/relation linking errors (Patidar et al., 2022). A failure to fetch even a single fact will block KBQA from computing the answer. Such cases of KB incompleteness are even more profound in the temporal context. To address this issue, we explore an interesting direction where a targeted temporal fact extraction technique is used to assist KBQA whenever it fails to retrieve temporal facts from the KB. We model the extraction problem as an open-domain question answering task using off-the-shelf language models. This way, we target to extract from textual resources those facts that failed to get retrieved from the KB. Experimental results on two temporal QA benchmarks show promising 30% & 10% relative improvements in answer  accuracies without any additional training cost.</p>

              <p >Existing works on Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) explicitly focus on developing more efficient fine-tuning approaches for the task. Different from these, we propose CONTRASTE, a novel pre-training strategy using CONTRastive learning to improve the performance of the downstream ASTE task. Given a sentence and its associated (aspect, opinion, sentiment) triplets, first, we design aspect-based prompts with corresponding sentiments masked. We then (pre)train an encoder-decoder architecture by applying contrastive learning on the decoder-generated aspect-aware sentiment representations of the masked terms. For fine-tuning the pre-trained model weights thus obtained, we then propose a novel multi-task approach where the base encoder-decoder framework is combined with two complementary modules, a tagging-based Opinion Term Detector, and a regression-based Triplet Count Estimator. Exhaustive experiments on four benchmark datasets and a detailed ablation study establish the importance of each of our proposed components as we achieve new state-of-the-art results for the ASTE task. We further demonstrate that our proposed pre-training scheme can improve the performance of other ABSA tasks such as Aspect Category Opinion Sentiment (ACOS) quad prediction, Target Aspect Sentiment Detection (TASD), and Aspect Extraction and Sentiment Classification (AESC).  </p>

              <p >Acronyms and long-forms are a common sight in research documents in general, more so in documents from scientific and legal domains. Many of the acronyms used in these documents are domain-specific, and are very rarely found in normal text corpora. Owing to this, transformer-based NLP models suffer while detecting OOV (Out of Vocabulary) for acronym tokens and their performance suffers while linking acronyms to their long forms during extraction. Moreover, transformer-based models like BERT are not specialized to handle scientific and legal documents. With these points being the overarching motivation behind this work, we propose a novel framework <b>CABACE</b>: <b>C</b>haracter-<b>A</b>ware <b>B</b>ERT for <b>AC</b>ronym <b>E</b>xtraction, that takes into account character sequences in text, and is adapted to the scientific and legal domains by masked language modelling. We further use an objective function with augmented loss function, adding mask + max loss for training CABACE. Experimental results prove the superiority of the proposed framework in comparison to various baselines. Additionally, we show that the proposed framework is better suited than baseline models for zero-shot generalization to non-English languages, thus reinforcing the effectiveness of our approach. Our team BacKGProp secured the highest scores on the French dataset, second highest on Danish and Vietnamese, and third highest in the Legal English dataset on the global Codalab leaderboard for the acronym extraction shared task at SDU AAAI-22.</p>

              <p >Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) systems have the goal of answering complex natural language questions by reasoning over relevant facts retrieved from Knowledge Bases (KB). One of the major challenges faced by these systems is their inability to retrieve all relevant facts due to factors such as incomplete KB and entity/relation linking errors. In this paper, we address this particular challenge for systems handling a specific category of questions called temporal questions, where answer derivation involve reasoning over facts asserting point/intervals of time for various events. We propose a novel approach where a targeted temporal fact extraction technique is used to assist KBQA whenever it fails to retrieve temporal facts from the KB. We use λ-expressions of the questions to logically represent the component facts and the reasoning steps needed to derive the answer. This allows us to spot those facts that failed to get retrieved from the KB and generate textual queries to extract them from the textual resources in an open-domain question answering fashion. We evaluated our approach on a benchmark temporal question answering dataset considering Wikidata and Wikipedia respectively as the KB and textual resource. Experimental results show a significant ∼30\% relative improvement in answer accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p>
